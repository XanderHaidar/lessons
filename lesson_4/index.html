        <p>
          Sir Lewis Carl Davidson Hamilton MBE HonFREng (born 7 January 1985) is
          a British racing driver currently competing in Formula One, driving
          for Mercedes. In Formula One, Hamilton has won a joint-record seven
          World Drivers' Championship titles (tied with Michael Schumacher), and
          holds the records for the
          <mark
            >most wins (103),pole positions (104), and podium finishes (197) </mark
          >, among others. Born and raised in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, Hamilton
          joined the McLaren Young Drier Programme in 1998. This led to a
          Formula One drive with McLaren from 2007 to 2012, making him the first
          black driver to race in the series. In his inaugural season, Hamilton
          set numerous records as he finished runner-up to Kimi Räikkönen by one
          point. The following season, he won his maiden title in dramatic
          fashion—making a crucial overtake on the last lap of the last race of
          the season—to become the then-youngest ever Formula One World
          Champion. After six years with McLaren, Hamilton signed with Mercedes
          in 2013. Changes to the regulations for 2014 mandating the use of
          turbo-hybrid engines saw the start of a highly successful period for
          Hamilton, during which he won six further drivers' titles. Consecutive
          titles came in 2014 and 2015 during an intense rivalry with teammate
          Nico Rosberg. Following Rosberg's retirement in 2016, Ferrari's
          Sebastian Vettel became Hamilton's closest rival in two championship
          battles, in which he twice overturned mid-season point deficits to
          claim consecutive titles again in 2017 and 2018. His third and fourth
          consecutive titles followed in 2019 and 2020 to equal Schumacher's
          record of seven drivers' titles. Hamilton has been credited with
          furthering Formula One's global following by appealing to a broader
          audience outside the sport, in part due to his high-profile lifestyle,
          environmental and social activism, and exploits in music and fashion.
          He has also become a prominent advocate in support of activism to
          combat racism and push for increased diversity in motorsport. Hamilton
          was listed in the 2020 issue of Time as one of the 100 most
          influential people globally, and was knighted in the 2021 New Year
          Honours.

        <h5 class="subtitle">Early life and education</h5>
        <p>
          Hamilton was born on 7 January 1985 in Stevenage, Hertfordshire. His
          father, Anthony Hamilton, is black and is of Grenadian descent, while
          his mother, Carmen Larbalestier, is White British, and from
          Birmingham, making him mixed-race; Hamilton has identified as black.
          Hamilton's parents separated when he was two, after which he lived
          with his mother and older half-sisters, Samantha and Nicola, until he
          was twelve.Hamilton then lived with his father, stepmother Linda, and
          his half-brother Nicolas, who is also a professional racing driver.
          Hamilton was raised a Catholic. Hamilton's father bought him a
          radio-controlled car when he was five. Hamilton finished second in the
          national BRCA championship the following year against adult
          competition. Being the only black child racing at his club, Hamilton
          was subjected to racist abuse. Hamilton's father bought him a go-kart
          for Christmas when he was six and promised to support his racing
          career as long as he worked hard at school. To support his son,
          Hamilton's father took redundancy from his position as an IT manager
          and became a contractor, sometimes working up to four jobs at a time
          including employment as a double glazing salesman, dishwasher, and
          putting up signs for estate agents, while still attending his son's
          races. Hamilton's father later set up his own IT company. He continued
          to be Hamilton's manager until early 2010. Hamilton was educated at
          The John Henry Newman School, a voluntary aided Catholic secondary
          school in Stevenage. Hamilton has said that at the age of five he took
          up karate to defend himself as a result of bullying at school. He was
          also excluded from school for a period when he was mistakenly
          identified as having attacked a fellow student who was treated in
          hospital for his injuries. In addition to racing, he played
          association football for his school team with eventual England
          international, Ashley Young. Hamilton, an Arsenal fan, said that if
          Formula One had not worked for him, he would have been a footballer or
          a cricketer, having played both for his school teams. In February
          2001, he began studies at Cambridge Arts and Sciences (CATS), a
          private sixth-form college in Cambridge.

        <h5 class="subtitle">Karting</h5>
        <p>
          Hamilton began karting in 1993 and quickly began winning races and
          cadet class championships.Two years later, he became the youngest
          driver to win the British cadet karting championship at the age of
          ten. That year, Hamilton approached McLaren Formula One team boss Ron
          Dennis at the Autosport Awards for an autograph and said: "Hi. I'm
          Lewis Hamilton. I won the British Championship and one day I want to
          be racing your cars."Dennis wrote in Hamilton's autograph book: "Phone
          me in nine years, we'll sort something out then." When Hamilton was
          12, Ladbrokes took a bet, at 40/1 odds, that Hamilton would win a
          Formula One race before the age of 23; another predicted, at 150/1
          odds, that he would win the World Drivers' Championship before he was
          25.In 1998, Dennis called Hamilton following his second Super One
          series and British championship wins,to offer Hamilton a role in the
          McLaren driver development programme.The contract included an option
          of a future Formula One seat, which would make Hamilton the youngest
          driver to secure a contract that later resulted in a Formula One
          drive.Hamilton continued his progress in the Intercontinental A
          (1999), Formula A (2000) and Formula Super A (2001) ranks, and became
          European Champion in 2000 with maximum points. In Formula A and
          Formula Super A, racing for TeamMBM.com, his teammate was Nico
          Rosberg, who would later drive for the Williams and Mercedes teams in
          Formula One; they would later team up again for Mercedes from 2013 to
          2016. Following his karting successes, the British Racing Drivers'
          Club made him a "Rising Star" Member in 2000.In 2001, Michael
          Schumacher made a one-off return to karts and competed against
          Hamilton along with other future Formula One drivers Vitantonio Liuzzi
          and Nico Rosberg. Hamilton ended the final in seventh, four places
          behind Schumacher. Although the two saw little of each other on the
          track, Schumacher praised the young Briton.

        <h5 class="subtitle">Formula Renault and Formula three</h5>
        <p>
          Hamilton began his car racing career in the 2001 British Formula
          Renault Winter Series, finishing fifth in the standings.This led to a
          full 2002 Formula Renault UK campaign with Manor Motorsport in which
          he finished fifth overall.He remained with Manor for another year,
          winning the championship ahead of Alex Lloyd.Having clinched the
          championship, Hamilton missed the last two races of the season to make
          his debut in the season finale of the British Formula 3
          Championship.In his first race he was forced out with a puncture,and
          in the second he crashed out and was taken to hospital after a
          collision with teammate Tor Graves.Asked in 2002 about the prospect of
          becoming one of the youngest ever Formula One drivers, Hamilton
          replied that his goal was "not to be the youngest in Formula One" but
          rather "to be experienced and then show what I can do in Formula
          One".He made his debut with Manor in the 2004 Formula 3 Euro Series,
          ending the year fifth in the championship.He also won the Bahrain F3
          Superprix and twice raced in the Macau F3 Grand Prix.Williams had come
          close to signing Hamilton but did not because BMW, their engine
          supplier at the time, would not fund him.Hamilton eventually re-signed
          with McLaren. According to then McLaren executive and future CEO
          Martin Whitmarsh, who was responsible for guiding Hamilton through the
          team's young driver programme, he and Anthony Hamilton had a "huge
          row" at the end of the season, with Lewis' father pushing for him to
          move up to GP2 for 2005, while Whitmarsh felt that he should remain in
          F3 for a second season, culminating in Whitmarsh tearing up Lewis'
          contract; however, Lewis called Whitmarsh six weeks later and
          re-signed with the team. Hamilton first tested for McLaren in late
          2004 at Silverstone. Hamilton moved to the reigning Euro Series
          champions ASM for the 2005 season and dominated the championship,
          winning 15 of the 20 rounds. He also won the Marlboro Masters of
          Formula 3 at Zandvoort. After the season British magazine Autosport
          featured him in their "Top 50 Drivers of 2005" issue, ranking Hamilton
          24th.

        <h5 class="subtitle">GP-2</h5>
        <p>
          Hamilton moved to ASM's sister GP2 team, ART Grand Prix, for the 2006
          season. Hamilton won the GP2 championship at his first attempt,
          beating Nelson Piquet Jr. and Alexandre Prémat. He secured a dominant
          win at the Nürburgring, despite a penalty for speeding in the pit
          lane. At his home race at Silverstone, Hamilton overtook two rivals at
          Becketts, a series of high-speed bends where overtaking is rare.In
          Istanbul he recovered from a spin that left him in eighteenth place to
          take second.Hamilton won the title in unusual circumstances,
          inheriting the final point he needed after Giorgio Pantano was
          stripped of fastest lap in the Monza feature race. Hamilton's success
          in the GP2 championship coincided with a vacancy at McLaren following
          the departure of Juan Pablo Montoya to NASCAR and Kimi Räikkönen to
          Ferrari.After months of speculation on whether Hamilton, Pedro de la
          Rosa or Gary Paffett would be paired with defending champion Fernando
          Alonso for 2007, Hamilton was confirmed as the team's second driver.
          He was told of McLaren's decision at the end of September, but the
          news was not made public for almost two months, for fear that it would
          be overshadowed by Michael Schumacher's retirement announcement.

          Hamilton's first season in Formula One saw him partner two-time and
          defending World Champion Fernando Alonso. Hamilton is the first and,
          as of 2023, the only black driver to race in the series. After
          finishing on the podium in his debut, Hamilton went on to set several
          records as he finished runner-up in the 2007 World Drivers'
          Championship to Kimi Räikkönen by one point, including those for the
          most consecutive podium finishes from debut , the joint most wins in a
          debut season and the most points in a debut season . Throughout the
          season, Hamilton and Alonso were involved in a number of incidents
          which resulted in tensions between both drivers and the team,
          culminating in Alonso and McLaren terminating their contract by mutual
          consent in November. Following a successful first season at McLaren,
          Hamilton signed a multi-million-pound contract to stay with the team
          until 2012. Hamilton's success continued in 2008 as he amassed five
          victories and ten podium finishes. As the season reached its
          conclusion in Brazil, it became a clear two-way fight for the title
          between the home favourite Felipe Massa and the young Briton. Hamilton
          won his first title in dramatic fashion in the last race of the
          season, the 2008 Brazilian Grand Prix, overtaking Timo Glock for fifth
          position in the final corners of the last lap to become the
          then-youngest Formula One World Champion in history and to deny
          race-winner Massa the title by one point. This made Hamilton the first
          British driver to win the World Championship since Damon Hill in
          1996.[64]In his last four years with McLaren, Hamilton continued to
          score podium finishes and race victories. Hamilton entered the final
          round of the 2010 season with a chance of winning the title, but
          ultimately finished fourth as Sebastian Vettel won the race to take
          his maiden drivers' crown. The following year was the first season he
          had been out-scored by a teammate, as Jenson Button finished runner-up
          to champion Sebastian Vettel, during a year in which distractions in
          his private life and run-ins with FIA officials saw Hamilton finish a
          lowly fifth in the standings, after which he vowed he would return to
          form for 2012. Hamilton achieved four race-wins in the 2012 season as
          he finished fourth in the standings. Before the end of the year,
          Hamilton announced, to much surprise, that he would be joining
          Mercedes for the 2013 season, replacing the retiring Michael
          Schumacher.

        <p>
          Upon signing with Mercedes in 2013, Hamilton was reunited with his
          childhood karting teammate, Nico Rosberg. The move was met with
          surprise by pundits and the public, with some describing the move to
          Mercedes, a team with no recent history of success, as a gamble. In
          his first season with the Silver Arrows, Hamilton secured a sole race
          victory, winning the Hungarian Grand Prix, where he converted an
          unexpected pole position into a winning margin of over 11 seconds
          ahead of second-place finisher Kimi Räikkönen,[69] alongside a number
          of podium finishes and pole positions, finishing fourth in the
          standings once again, the third time in five years. Changes to
          regulations for the 2014 season, which mandated the use of
          turbo-hybrid engines, contributed to the start of a highly successful
          era for Hamilton. That year saw Mercedes win 16 of the 19 races that
          season, 11 of those secured by Hamilton as he prevailed in a
          season-long duel for the title against teammate Rosberg. Clinching his
          second drivers' title, and eclipsing the victory tally of all British
          drivers before him, Hamilton declared over team-radio after the final
          race in Abu Dhabi: "This is the greatest day of my life."[66] New
          driver number regulations brought in for 2014 allowed drivers to pick
          a unique car number to use for their entire career, and so Hamilton
          elected to drive under his old karting No. 44 for the remainder of his
          career. Before the start of the 2015 season, Hamilton announced he
          would not be exercising his option of switching his car number to 1,
          as was his prerogative as reigning World Champion, and would instead
          continue to race with his career No. 44. It was the first season since
          1994, when Alain Prost retired from the sport following his fourth and
          final World Drivers' Championship title in 1993, that the field did
          not contain a car bearing the No. 1. Hamilton dominated the 2015
          season, winning ten races finishing on the podium a record seventeen
          times as he matched his hero Ayrton Senna's three World Championships
          titles. The rivalry between him and Rosberg intensified, climaxing in
          a heated battle at the US Grand Prix where Hamilton won in an
          action-packed, wheel-to-wheel battle with his teammate to clinch the
          title with three races to spare.[66] That year, Hamilton extended his
          contract with Mercedes for three additional years in a deal reportedly
          worth more than £100 million, making him one of the best-paid drivers
          in Formula One,as well as allowing Hamilton to retain his own image
          rights, which is considered unusual in the sport, and keep his
          championship-winning cars and trophies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite recording more pole positions and race wins than any other
          driver in 2016, Hamilton lost the drivers' title by five points to his
          teammate, Rosberg. The team's policy of letting the pair fight freely
          led to several acrimonious exchanges both on and off the track,
          culminating in Hamilton defying team-orders at the season finale in
          Abu Dhabi and deliberately slowing to back Rosberg into the chasing
          pack at the end of the race in an unsuccessful bid to encourage other
          drivers to overtake his teammate, which would have allowed him to win
          the title.Ultimately, a succession of poor starts from Hamilton early
          in the season and a crucial engine blowout in Malaysia meant Rosberg
          took the title, which he successfully secured before announcing his
          shock retirement from the sport immediately after beating his rival.
        </p>
        <p>
          Following Rosberg's retirement, Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel became
          Hamilton's closest rival as the pair exchanged the championship lead
          throughout 2017 in a tense title fight. Hamilton registered 11 pole
          positions that season as he took the record for the all-time most pole
          positions, and his consistency (finishing every race in the points),
          as well as a lack of a serious challenge from his new teammate
          Valtteri Bottas, saw him record nine race victories and secure his
          fourth World Drivers' title as he overturned a points deficit to
          Vettel in the first half of the season, ultimately wrapping the title
          up in Mexico with two races to spare.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>
            The 2018 season was the first tie that two four-time World
            Champions, Hamilton and Vettel, would be competing for a fifth title
            and was billed as the "Fight for Five" by journalists and fans.
          </span>
          As with the season before, Ferrari and Vettel appeared to have the
          upper hand for much of the season, topping the standings until the
          half-way point. However, Vettel's season unravelled with a number of
          driver and mechanical errors, while Hamilton's run of six wins in
          seven in the latter half of the season saw Hamilton clinch the title
          in Mexico for a second year running as he set a new record for the
          most points scored in a season During the season, Hamilton signed a
          two-year contract with Mercedes, reported to be worth up to £40
          million per year, making him the best-paid Formula One driver in
          history.

          Having signed a contrat with Mercedes that lasted until 2020, it was
          confirmed Hamilton would defend his title in 2019. Hamilton led the
          drivers' standings for the majority of the season, fending off title
          challenges from team-mate Bottas, the Honda-powered Red Bull of
          Verstappen and Ferrari's recently promoted Leclerc, to clinch his
          sixth drivers' crown at the 2019 United States Grand Prix with two
          races remaining. After scoring his sixth career grand slam in the
          final race of the season, Hamilton ended the season with 11 wins
          (matching his previous best in 2014 and 2018) and 17 podiums (matching
          the all-time record for a fourth time) as well as achieving 5 pole
          positions. His total of 413 points for the season was a new all-time
          record, seeing the Briton finish 87 points clear of second-placed
          Bottas.

            >Hamilton won his seventh drivers' title in 2020</span
          >, equalling the record set by Schumacher, in a season heavily
          impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Over the shortened seventeen-race
          season, Hamilton took 11 wins (equalling his previous personal best,
          but in fewer races) including one in Portugal to break Schumacher's
          record of 91 wins.He also took 14 podiums and 10 pole positions.
          Hamilton missed the 2020 Sakhir Grand Prix after contracting COVID-19,
          his first race absence since his debut in 2007. Hamilton clinched the
          title at the 2020 Turkish Grand Prix with three rounds to spare and
          ended the season 124 points clear of his team-mate, Bottas, who
          finished second in the standings.[90] Amid Formula One's We Race as
          One campaign and growing global support for the Black Lives Matter
          movement, Hamilton took the knee ahead of every race he entered and
          wore t-shirts bearing the Black Lives Matter slogan. Hamilton and
          Bottas' W11 cars also sported a black livery as a statement of
          Mercedes' commitment to diversity.

          <span class="special">
            Early on in the 2021 season, Hamilton and Red Bull's Max Verstappen
            emerged as title favourites.
          </span>
          The pair frequently exchanged the championship lead throughout the
          season—often sparring (and occasionally coming together) on track—and
          entered the last race in Abu Dhabi level on points. In Abu Dhabi,
          Verstappen overtook Hamilton on the final lap of the race, denying
          Hamilton his eighth title. During the season, Hamilton became the
          first driver to surpass 100 pole positions and 100 race wins,
          respectively.The season finale was marred by controversy over race
          director Michael Masi's decision to instruct only the lapped cars
          separating Verstappen and Hamilton to un-lap themselves under the
          safety car, which eliminated any gap between the pair and allowed the
          Dutchman, running newly fitted soft tyres, to enter the final lap
          immediately behind Hamilton on his worn hard tyres.Four days after the
          race, the FIA announced that it would conduct an internal
          investigation into the incident. Masi was subsequently removed from
          his role as race director, with the FIA World Motor Sport Council
          report finding that "human error" resulted in the failure to follow
          Formula One Sporting Regulations concerning the withdrawal of the
          safety car, but also that the final standings "are valid, final and
          cannot now be changed."[100] Notwithstanding the controversy in Abu
          Dhabi, BBC Sport's Andrew Benson described the season as "one of the
          most intense, hard-fought battles in sporting history", with Hamilton
          and Verstappen having "been head and shoulders—and a lot more—clear of
          every other driver on the grid."Hamilton was partnered by George
          Russell for 2022, in place of the departing Bottas.The season saw
          significant changes in technical regulations which sought to utilise
          ground effect to generate downforce. During pre-season testing in
          Bahrain, Mercedes introduced its "zero sidepod" car design, which was
          radically different to that of its competitors. The Mercedes W13
          suffered with extreme porpoising early in the season which limited the
          car's potential; at the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, Hamilton deemed the
          car "undrivable".During the first half of the season, Hamilton was
          marginally low on points compared to Russell, despite having been
          involved in the development of the W13, he had to try on experimental
          car setups until the British Grand Prix. As his car development
          contributions were concluded, he was able to perform better. Hamilton
          scored more podium finishes and championship points than Russell
          during the second half of the season. During the season Hamilton set
          records such as, most consecutive seasons with at least one podium
          finish, most consecutive seasons with at least one lap led, most races
          with a single constructor, most Q3 appearances, most top 10 finishes
          and most chequered flags reached at the Monaco Grand Prix, most podium
          finishes at a single circuit, most points scored at the Monza Circuit
          and most podium finishes at the United States Grand Prix. By the end
          of the season, Hamilton achieved nine podiums but failed to achieve a
          race win or pole position in a season for the first time in his
          Formula One career. He finished in sixth place in the drivers'
          championship, 35 points behind Russell, who finished fourth. But
          Hamilton managed to qualify on higher grid positions and scored more
          podium finishes than Russell. Mercedes started the 2023 season with
          concerns over their competitiveness, with Hamilton saying they were
          "not where they wanted to be" after preseason testing. He finished
          fifth in the opening race in Bahrain, over 50 seconds behind the
          winner Verstappen. Hamilton achieved his first podium of the season in
          Australia to extend his ownAfter back to back podium finishes in Spain
          and Canada, he fought from seventh on the grid to take third place at
          his home race at Silverstone. At the 2023 Hungarian Grand Prix
          Hamilton qualified 0.003 seconds in front of Verstappen to take his
          104th pole position and his first since 2021. On 31 August 2023, the
          day before the first practice session of the 2023 Italian Grand Prix,
          Hamilton signed a two-year contract to remain with Mercedes through
          the 2025 season. George Russell also signed a two-year extension,
          retaining Mercedes' driver pair.At the 2023 Singapore Grand Prix,
          Hamilton qualified fifth, but would finish the race in third after
          inheriting the position after Russell crashed out from third place on
          the last lap.
